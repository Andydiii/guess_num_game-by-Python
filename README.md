# guess_num_game-by-Python

- In this game, you can just run it and choose whether you want to guess or let the computer guess.

Steps:
- run it
- enter 'me' if you wanna guess
- enter 'c' if you want computer to guess the num you are thinking of
- enter one number as guessing upper bound. e.g. if you enter 100, then you should guess from 1 - 100.
if you choose the computer guessing mode:
- you should have a answer in your heart instead of entering the number.
- if the number that computer gave is higher than answer, enter l(means larger).
- enter s(means smaller than answer)
- if the number is correct, enter c.
if you choose the self-guessing mode:
just guess the number and enter it.
it stops when you guess the right one.
